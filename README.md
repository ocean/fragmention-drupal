Introduction
------------

The Fragmention module implements a JavaScript polyfill for the [Fragmention concept](http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention) which was created by [Kevin Marks](http://kevinmarks.com) on the [Indie Web Camp](http://indiewebcamp.com/) discussion forum.

>Fragmentions find the first matching word or phrase in a document and focuses its closest surrounding element. The match is determined by the case-sensitive string following the ## double-hash. The closest surrounding element may be a span, paragraph, heading, button, input, or any other container.

This module is a simple implementation of [Jonathan Neal's](http://www.jonathantneal.com/) [Fragmentions script](https://github.com/chapmanu/fragmentions).
